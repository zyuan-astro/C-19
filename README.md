# C-19
 The memberlist of the C-19 stream

source_id: Gaia EDR3 id

feh_pr: the phtometric metallcities from Pristine

rv: The best radial velocity measured

feh: The spectroscopic metallicities from the best measurements. [FeII/H] values from HR spectra are listed if available, otherwise [FeI/H]_LTE (HR) values are used. If neither measurement is available, [FeI/H]_LTE (LR) derived from OSIRIS spectra are listed. See details in Table 1.

note: We list the instruments used to obtain spectra. NEW specifies the new members confirmed in this paper. For the BHB stars, we notify those unlikely candidates based on their on-sky positions and proper motion measurements.
